## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
schools <- readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("US_schools_data.xlsx"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
schools_clean <- schools %>% 
  select(
    PRIMARY_KEY, TOTAL_EXPENDITURE, INSTRUCTION_EXPENDITURE, SUPPORT_SERVICES_EXPENDITURE, OTHER_EXPENDITURE, CAPITAL_OUTLAY_EXPENDITURE, ends_with(c("READING", "MATHEMATICS"))
    ) %>% separate(PRIMARY_KEY, into = c("YEAR", "STATE"))
```

```{r}
schools_clean <- schools_clean %>%
  pivot_longer(8:47, names_to = c("GRADE", "RACE", "SEX", "TEST"), names_sep ="_", values_to = "TEST_SCORES")
```
